    <h2>A Flavorful Journey: The Perfect Biryani</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a rich, aromatic dish that brings together fragrant basmati rice, tender marinated meat (usually chicken, mutton, or beef), and a blend of spices that make every bite a celebration of flavor. Originating from South Asia, this beloved dish has countless regional variations, each adding its unique twist. The long-grain rice, cooked to perfection, is layered with the spicy, savory meat and topped with fried onions, giving it a satisfying crunch. Often served with yogurt-based raita or a hard-boiled egg, biryani is more than just food; it’s a cultural experience enjoyed by many around the world.</p>

<h3>Steps to Make the Perfect Biryani:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Marinate the Meat: In a bowl, combine your choice of meat (chicken, mutton, or beef) with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb all the flavors.</li>
<li>Cook the Rice: Boil basmati rice until 70% cooked, then drain and set aside.

</li>
<li>Prepare the Base: Fry onions in oil or ghee, then add tomatoes, mint, coriander, and the marinated meat. Cook until tender.</li>
<li>Layer the Biryani: In a separate pot, layer the cooked rice on top of the meat mixture. Sprinkle fried onions, mint, coriander, and a bit of lemon juice over the rice. Cover the pot with a lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
<li>Serve & Enjoy: Once the biryani is ready, gently fluff the rice and meat together. Serve hot with raita or a boiled egg on the side for the ultimate biryani experience!</li>
