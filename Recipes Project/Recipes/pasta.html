    <h2>Pasta Primavera: A Fresh & Flavorful Italian Delight</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta Primavera is a vibrant and refreshing dish that celebrates the
      flavors of fresh, seasonal vegetables. Traditionally made with al dente
      pasta and a mix of sautéed vegetables like bell peppers, zucchini, cherry
      tomatoes, and peas, this dish offers a perfect balance of crunch and
      tenderness. Tossed in a light olive oil or creamy sauce, it's a healthier
      yet indulgent Italian classic that’s bursting with flavor. Whether you’re
      enjoying it as a side dish or a main course, Pasta Primavera is perfect
      for any occasion, especially during the warmer months when fresh veggies
      are in abundance.
